.SH DESCRIPTION
These programs are user utilites to be used together with the
.IR x10 (4)
X10 controller program. The
.I gui
program
is a graphical user interface that shows the status of the X10 devices.
It presents a box for each control that is shown in yellow when the device is
on. A click with mouse button 3 or button 1
on any device would toggle its state. If
the command fails, the device is shown in red for a while. A click with mouse
button 2 would toggle the write permission on the file (useful to prevent
other commands from switching the device). The devices shown
are those in
.B /devs/x10
or in
.I dir
(when specified). If a set of
.I file
arguments is given, only those devices are shown.
.PP
.I Ox10
is similar to
.I gui
but intended for use within
.IR omero (1).
Its arguments are the list of files/directories
where to find the X10 devices. By default,
.B /devs/x10
is used and only devices configured with a name are shown.
.PP
.B Power
is a program that controls the power source of terminals and lights
as well as the
audio output volume depending on the presence of a human in the room,
as determined by the X10 device
specified by
.IR whofile .
.PP
Each
.I termfile
given is switched off when there is no human detected by
more than half an hour. It is switched on when the human comes back.
.PP
Each
.I light
given is switched off when there is no human detected by
more than one minute. It is switched on when the human comes back.
.PP
Each
.I volfile
volume control given to option
.B -v
is set to zero (mute) when there is no human during more
than one minute. The volume is restored to its previous value when the
human comes back. If a volume file is given to option
.B -n
the volume is lowered to a 40% when there is a human detected, and
restored to its previous state otherwise. This option is useful to lower the
volume level while a visit is detected.
.SH EXAMPLE
Run this at your cpu server so your terminal power and room light
are handled from there. 
.EX
	; cpu
	cpu% 9fs x10  && cd /n/x10
	cpu% x10/power -t pwr:136term -l pwr:136light who:136
.EE
Run this at your terminal to adjust your volume level.
.EX
	; 9fs x10  && cd /n/x10
	; x10/power -v /dev/volume who:136
.EE
.SH SOURCE

.SH SEE ALSO
.IR x10 (4),
.IR env (8).
.SH BUGS
Too many user interfaces. All but
.I ox10
will go in the future. X10 is not reliable.
