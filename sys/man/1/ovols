.TH OVOLS 1
.SH NAME
ovols \- list volumes in use
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B ovols
[
.B -dv
]
[
.I dir
.B ...
]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Ovols
prints, for each volume mount point given as an argument,
the volume used within the
namespace where it runs. The list is shown within a
.IR omero (1)
panel. When a volume is switched, and a different volume becomes used,
the program flashes the omero panel several times to alert the user of the
change.
.PP
Flag
.B -v
makes the program verbose, to make even more noise upon volume changes. Flag
.B -d
enables debug diagnostics.
.PP
If you are using this program, you did mess up your namespace enough not to be
sure of what you are using. We suggest you cleanup your namespace instead.
