.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.I ofaces
command displays in
.IR omero (1)
a representation of users related to a set of files,
using a small image for each user. Usually, each (user face related
to a) file shown
corresponds to a mail message, but it may also correspond
to who is present in the environment or to something else (depending
on the given arguments).
The image is typically a portrait of the user. Which image to 
display is determined by two directories /usr/$user/lib/face 
and /lib/face. Entries in /usr/$user/lib/face take priority over 
those in /lib/face. See 
.IR face (6),
for how these directories are organised.
.PP
The argument
.I cmd
is executed by
.I ofaces
to determine which file names must be shown and which user is to be shown
for each file. This program is expected to print one line per file with the absolute
file path, and equal sign, and the mail address for the user to be shown. By default,
.B "Mails -l
is used, which shows the list of mails in the Plan B mailbox for the user.
.PP
The user interface is as described in
.IR omero (1).
Looking for a face causes the associated file name to be `plumbed'.
A typical plumb action will be to display the message.
.PP
Option
.B -d
enables debug messages. Option
.B -l
changes the label shown near the faces. By default, this label  is the basename
of the program used to list the faces to be shown.
.PP
If a voice output volume is mounted,
.I ofaces
alerts of user arrivals by using
.IR print (2)
(with format
.I infmt
and the user name as the only argument) on the voice output device.
.PP
Option
.B -o
is similar, but notifies of user leaves.
