.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.I Omail
is a
.I omero
mail reader. Its user interface can be handled as said in
.IR omero (1).
Its primary use is for composing and sending mail. Mail reading is best done
with
.IR Mails (1),
which would start
.I omail
when necessary to compose new mails and replies. Beware that this program
will soon be replaced by a Plan B mail delivery volume, which would render it
obsolete.
.PP
When used with option
.BR -n ,
it starts a composition panel and does nothing else. An optional address may
be supplied and, in this case, an optional subject string may be given.
.PP
Option
.B -o
sets
.I outgoing
as the Plan 9 folder where to keep a copy of sent mail. By default it is
.B /mail/box/$user/outgoing
unless
.I maildir
specifies an alternate path to the user's mail directory.
.PP
In the composition panel, headers are single lines before the first
empty one. The rest is considered as the body of the message. Any
.B Attach:
header attaches the named file. The
.B Include:
header includes inline attachments. Other headers are as in other
mail programs.
.PP
The
.IR marshal (1)
program is used to deliver the mail. See its manual page for details and
for available user configuration files.
.PP
When used to read mail, the program uses
.IR netplumber (4),
in particular
.BR seemail ,
.BR showmail ,
and
.BR sendmail
ports. See
.IR mail (1).
.PP
The mailbox is shown as kept on disk. As a safeguard,
deleted mail is a saved to a monthly folder at
.BR /mail/box/$user .
Options
.B -s
and
.B -S
make
.I omail
more conservative (and even more so) with regard to the available line width.

.SH BUGS

mail sending as well.
