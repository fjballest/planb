.TH CNSTR 6
.SH NAME
cnstr \- Plan B volume constraints and attributes
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The Plan B
.IR bns (4)
program permits the application to mount
at a given mount point those volumes whose names and attributes
match the ones given as arguments, as said in
.IR planb (1).
.PP
Volume attributes can be used as
constraints to determine which ones of the
volumes available for a given mount point are of interest for
the application. A
constraint is a set of values for attributes that refer to
properties of the resource volume. Both volume announces and volume
mount requests carry a constraint used to pair them.
.PP
A constraint is a single argument, field, or string. Its format is a set
of
.IR attr = value
pairs delimited by white space. No space may be around the equal
sign. Also, when using
.IR rc (1),
it is important to quote all the attribute/value pairs together, or they would
become different constraints, and not a single one.
.SH ATTRIBUTES
.PP
By convention, the following attribute names and values are used through the system, 
This convention should be followed or users will not know how to request a given
property for a resource. Of course, this is highly regional and the version shown here
corresponds to customs at URJC.
