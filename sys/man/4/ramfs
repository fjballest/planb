.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Ramfs
services a ram file system for temporary and volatile files. By default,
.I ramfs
mounts itself at
.BR /tmp .
Option
.B -m
can be used to mount it at
.I mnt
instead. Flags
.B -abc
mount after, before, and allowing file creation, as
.IR mount (2)
describes.
.PP
In the same way, options
.B -s
and
.B -n
request the server to register
.I srv
with
.IR srv (3)
and to listen for clients
at network address
.IR addr .
Clients are authenticated via
.IR factotum (4)
unless flag
.B -A
is given or the client connects from the local machine.
.PP
This program is useful as a volatile place holder of
information that must be exported to the network in
a secure way. It is a good candidate to place on it
synthetized and context information for others to know.
.PP
The
.B -V
option makes
.I ramfs
announce the volume with the given
.I volspec
and appropriate default constraints for the user name, system name, and
location.
.PP
The
.B -D
flag shows 9P messages sent and received, for diagnostics.
.PP
In gereral, the options related to Plan B file servers for volumes are described
in
.IR planbfs (4)
and have the same meaning in this and other file servers developed for Plan B.
