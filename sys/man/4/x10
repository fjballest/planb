.SH DESCRIPTION
.I X10
is a network for house automation that uses the electrical
wiring of the house. The network is made of several house areas, identified
by a house code (hc). Each house code has several devices,
identified by a device code (dc). House codes go from
.B a
to
.B p.
Device codes go from
.B 1
to
.B 16.
.PP
This program
is a file system (and a shell) to talk to X10 CM11 controllers. It
can be used to request status for the X10 devices controlled,
and also to issue commands to the devices. By default it services
all devices with house code
.B a;
option
.B -h
can be used to service a different house. The program
services its file system at network address
.B tcp!*!x10
and accepts multiple concurrent clients mounting the X10 services.
.PP
The file tree serviced is a single directory with a
.B cm11
file that represents the controller, plus one extra file
per device controlled. Device file names are made out of
the house and device names. For example, the file
.B a1
represents a device using
.B 1
as the device code and
.B a
as the house code. As the controller sees devices (for example,
due to commands from the remote control), it adds the
corresponding files to the directory.
.PP
A
.IR write (2)
to the
.B cm11
file can be used to execute any of the commands listed below that refer
to a house or a device.
A
.IR read(2)
on a device file returns any of the strings
.B on
and
.B off
depending on the device status. A
.IR write (2)
to a device file executes the command supplied using as the
house and device codes those of the device. For example, a write
with the string
.B on
to the file
.B a1
would execute the command
.B "on a 1"
(which turns the device on).
.PP
Permission checking is implemented. Both the
.B cm11
and device files accept
.IR wstat (2)
requests to change the owner and permissions. However,
the owner can be changed just once, further
attempts are refused. Permissions can be changed too.
This can be used to assign
ownership of x10 switches to their legitimate owners and
to prevent accidental power offs. Users are authenticated
using
.IR factotum (4)
prior to granting access to the file system, but note
that any x10
controller plugged in a wall could command devices at will.
The user who started the program is always
considered as a file owner, regarding permission checking..
.PP
By default, x10 uses
.B /dev/eia0
as the serial device to reach the CM11 controller. Option
.B -d
can be used to use another device.
.PP
Flag
.B -i
makes the program accept commands like a shell, instead of servicing
its file tree. This is useful to diagnose problems. Option
.B -q
makes x10 quiet, and combined with
.B -i
can be used to pipe commands from
standard input. Option
.B -D
on the other hand, makes it verbose, for debugging. By supplying
this option more than once, extra diagnostics may be enabled. The program
logs events and diagnostics to the
.B /sys/log/x10\fIH\fP
file, where \fIH\fP is the house code.
.PP
The following commands are available:
.TP "bright hc dc dim"
.BI s
loads the CM11 status information (only available in interactive mode).
.TP
.BI d
dumps the loaded status (only available in interactive mode).
.TP
.BI q
quits (only available in interactive mode).
.TP
.BI p
prints the set of devices known, and their status (only available in interactive mode).
.TP
.BI alloff " hc"
switches off all devices with the same house code.
.TP
.BI lightson " hc" 
turns on the lights.
.TP
.BI on " hc dc" 
switches the device on.
.TP
.BI off " hc dc" 
switches the device off.
.TP
.BI dim " hc dc dim" 
sets up a dim ammount (from 0 to 100%) for the device. This is dangerous,
since the device controlled might be a terminal (despite using an X10 light
switch).
.TP
.BI bright " hc dc dim" 
sets up a bright ammount (from 0 to 100%) for the device. This is dangerous,
for the same reason.
.TP
.BI lightsoff " hc" 
turns off the lights.
.TP
.BI stson " hc" 
sends a status on to the CM11. This and the next two commands
are implemented for debugging purposes, the file system already issues
status requests to maintain an updated view of the X10 world.
.TP
.BI stsoff " hc" 
sends a status off to the CM11.
.TP
.BI stsreq " hc" 
issues a status request to the CM11.
.LP
Upon starting, this program reads command lines from the file
.B /sys/lib/x10conf
(or 
.I conf
if given)
that are executed as if sent to the
.B cm11
file. This can be used to switch on certain devices after
a power failure. Besides, a line with format
.EX
	perm HD user group mode
.EE
would setup permissions for the device with house and
device code
.B HD
to the given user, group and mode. The device code 0
can be used to refer to the cm11 file.
A line of the format
.EX
	name HD name
.EE
would make the file name for device
.B HD
to be
the given one. Comments are allowed using
.IR rc (1)
syntax.
.SH EXAMPLE
With this configuration file
.EX
	# house a serviced by victim
	# cm11, victim
	perm a0 nemo planb 0660
	
	# power source
	on a 1
	perm a1 nemo nemo 0664
	name a1 pwr:136term
	
	# motion detector
	off a 5
	perm a5 nemo planb 0444
	name a5 who:136
.EE
This can start and mount the service, and
switch the a1 and a3 devices off.
.EX
	; x10/fs
	; 9fs tcp!localhost!x10
	; echo off > /n/x10/pwr:136term
	; echo off a 3 > /n/x10/cm11

.SH BUGS
X10 is not reliable since commands may be silently
ignored by devices, and it provides no
means for authentication, as far as we know.
Some CM11 functions, not mentioned here, are either unimplemented
or untested. Only house code A has been thoroughly exercised,
using other house codes may be unreliable.
