.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Mfs
services a volume for playing media files. By default, it provides a service
to reproduce MPEG 2 Layer 3 files. Using it together with
.I speaksrvstd
to provide a speech service is also common.
It listens for 9P clients at the network address
.B tcp!*!audio
by default. Flags
.B -abcAD
and options
.B -Vsmn
are like those in most file servers and are described in
.IR planbfs (4).
.PP
The player command used to decode the media file is by default
.B mpeg3play -
and receives the MPEG file through stdin.
.PP
This
can be changed using option
.BR -p .
Most notably, the voice volume relies on this option to wrap speech
programs. This is done by using
.I speaksrvstd
as the underlying program. This program delivers the text given as
arguments to a remote speech utility (Festival for Linux, in the version
distributed for this program). Before delivering the text, the filter
.I spellwords
is applied to the text, if such filter exists. This is useful to translate the
text to a more appropriate format for speech, e.g., replace
.B planb
with
.B "plan b"
and other similar rewrites.
.PP
If option
.B -w
is supplied
to
.IR mfs ,
each write pipes to a different instance of the underlying program.
Option
.B -d
enables debug messages, and
.B -D
enables even more debugging.
.PP
Option
.B -v
enables a volume control file.
.PP
The volume announces itself as
.B /devs/audio
unless a different name is given with the
.B -V
option.
