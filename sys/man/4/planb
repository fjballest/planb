.SH DESCRIPTION
A Plan B environment is built by assembling multiple volume file servers into
a name space, through
.IR bns (4).
All volume file servers have a common set of options described here
using
.I planbfs
(which is not a real program) as an example. The common behaviour found in most
Plan B file servers is also described.
.PP
Also, the file name space of a Plan B terminal should adhere
to a number of conventions if the system is to behave normally. 
This page documents below the Plan B
specific details, as reflected by the
.B /lib/namespace.planb
file used during the boot process.
See
.IR namespace (4)
for the common Plan 9 conventions.
.SS Volume file severs
A
.I planbfs
program accepts 9P clients and authenticates them if they reach the
file server from a different machine (not from a pipe or a local network address).
Option
.B -A
disables authentication.
.PP
The file server usually mounts itself at a default mount point, or at
.I mnt
when given. Options
.B -abc
are like in
.IR mount (1)
and control the mount flag used in this case.
.PP
The network address where the file server listens for new clients
depends on the service provided by the volume. See
.B /lib/ndb/common
for a list of Plan B TCP services. This may be changed by supplying
.I addr
with the
.B -n
flag. 
.PP
Flag
.B -d
enables debugging. Many times, debugging may be made even more
verbose by repeating the flag, or by using
.B -D
instead.
.PP
The
.B -V
option supplies the volume spec, i.e., its global name and set of attributes.
This is used to announce the volume. Some file servers may insist in announcing
a particular volume spec when none is given. Most of them will not announce
if this flag is not used. For example, this might be used
.EX
	omero -V /devs/ui
	omero -V '/devs/ui sys=fake'
.EE
to start a window system and announce it as
.BR /devs/ui ,
and to start a second one pretending to be running at a
.B fake
system.
.PP
Some attributes, most notably
.BR user ,
.BR sys ,
and
.B loc
will be added by the file server to reflect the user who started the
service, the system where it runs, and the location at the time the
service was started (as known by the system). See
.IR cnstr (6)
for the conventions regarding attributes.
